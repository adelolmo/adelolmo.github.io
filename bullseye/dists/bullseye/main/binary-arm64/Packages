Description: Spin down idle hard disks
 hd-idle is a utility program for spinning-down external disks after a period
 of idle time. Since most external IDE disk enclosures don't support setting
 the IDE idle timer, a program like hd-idle is required to spin down idle disks
 automatically.
 .
 A word of caution: hard disks don't like spinning up too often. Laptop disks
 are more robust in this respect than desktop disks but if you set your disks
 to spin down after a few seconds you may damage the disk over time due to the
 stress the spin-up causes on the spindle motor and bearings. It seems that
 manufacturers recommend a minimum idle time of 3-5 minutes, the default in
 hd-idle is 10 minutes.
