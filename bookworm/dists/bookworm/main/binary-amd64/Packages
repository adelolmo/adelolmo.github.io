Description: Network-wide ads & trackers blocking DNS server
 AdGuard Home is a network-wide software for blocking ads & tracking.
 After you set it up, it'll cover ALL your home devices, and you don't need
 any client-side software for that.
 .
 It operates as a DNS server that re-routes tracking domains to a
 "black hole", thus preventing your devices from connecting to those servers.
 It's based on software we use for our public AdGuard DNS servers -- both
 share a lot of common code.

Description: Spin down idle hard disks
 hd-idle is a utility program for spinning-down external disks after a period
 of idle time. Since most external IDE disk enclosures don't support setting
 the IDE idle timer, a program like hd-idle is required to spin down idle disks
 automatically.
 .
 A word of caution: hard disks don't like spinning up too often. Laptop disks
 are more robust in this respect than desktop disks but if you set your disks
 to spin down after a few seconds you may damage the disk over time due to the
 stress the spin-up causes on the spindle motor and bearings. It seems that
 manufacturers recommend a minimum idle time of 3-5 minutes, the default in
 hd-idle is 10 minutes.
